# MLB 2018 Postseason Schedule Project

This project will sort the 2018 MLB Postseason games by *date* and by *series*.

The view can be toggled with the two buttons below the simple navigation 

Initially used flexbox to stack elements and make it responsive, but, I decided to mimic the existing schedule table element as much as possible, also rendered the info shown in the schedule using the screenshot as a reference.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`
